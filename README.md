# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Model
A machine learning project focused on  data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and supervised learning model evaluation.   The project uses a multivariate dataset with 10+ features and demonstrates the full pipeline from raw data to model performance comparison.
Features
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  
- Applied **data wrangling & preprocessing**:
  - Missing value imputation
  - Categorical encoding
  - Feature scaling
- Built and evaluated multiple **supervised ML models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Compared models using **accuracy, precision, and mean squared error (MSE)**  
- Visualized correlations, distributions, and model results
